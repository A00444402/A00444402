ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Advait Joshi! My preferred email is advaitjoshi1998@gmail.com
My A# is A00444402. I'm a bibliophile and autodidact who loves exploring anything I can 
my hands on, from history and economics to programming and cardistry.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, machine learning, data extraction, analysis and visualization, 
I have two years of experience as a senior data engineer (mainly ETL stuff) so my key strenghts are Python and Postgres.
- I can't wait to see what you've got for us, Professors Dan and Neil!
